#### Malware Blocking

For the purpose of this demo we have used EICAR Official site: https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt
When the extension is enabled the site is blocked.

Disable the extension and visit the same site! (Disclamer: The EICAR site is "safe" but we recommend you to keep Malware protection turned on!)
